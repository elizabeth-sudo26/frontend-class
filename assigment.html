    <h1>My name is Elizabeth</h1>
    <p>I am Nigerian by birth<br/>
        I reside in Ibadan, but school in Ogun state.<br/>
        I am a 3rd year Computer science major, looking forward to being a certified fullstack engineer.<br/>
        My passion for writing codes began when I was in SS3, when an alumnus taught me the basics of coding.<br/>
        Hence, here I am at AppClick ICT Academy, learning frontend engineering from a professsional and hoping to be fully certified at the end of the program.
